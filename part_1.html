        <h3>What is this app?</h3>
        <p>
            This web app is a place to connect with neighbours in your
            neighbourhood to find out about local events happening.
        </p>
        <h3>Some sample user stories</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                David is new to the neighbourhood and would like to meet up with
                some people. However, he is a bit shy and does not like
                approaching people in-person to ask if they want to meet up;
                instead, he wants to be able to find an online community where
                many of his neighbours are connected to find out about local
                events to attend.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heather, a computer scientist, has lived in the neighbourhood
                for a while. When she first moved in (long before COVID), she
                used to attend lots of local events that would be advertised on
                pieces of paper attached to power poles, giving her a chance to
                connect with people. However, when COVID-19 came, nobody was
                socializing for a while, and even though more people are
                gathering now, the rate at which the neighbours hang out is
                still much less than it used to be. Heather would like to revive
                that, in a way where people can simply log on online. She does
                not want to simply set up some big online chatroom, as that does
                not really solve the problem of people meeting up in-person.
                Instead, she wants to set up a local online billboard where she
                and all the neighbours can advertise social gatherings and more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Jeff is a friendly neighbour who does a lot for his community,
                such as organizing meetups, running charity events, helping in
                people's gardens, and much more. However, even though the people
                who know him really appreciate his help, he wishes he could help
                more people, as he figures there are lots of neighbours who
                could use a bit more help. By giving everyone a convenient
                online hub to check occasionally, he can reach out to more
                people easily who may need help.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For Jeff, what are his 5 needs that he can use this app for?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Advertising a local-firefighter charity event</li>
            <li>
                Offering help to older people who need help cleaning their
                gardens
            </li>
            <li>
                Doing cheaper local food delivery (cheaper than Uber Eats, for
                example)
            </li>
            <li>Advertising a BBQ evening at the local park</li>
            <li>
                Offering to salt people's sidewalks if people are away when it
                freezes
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is the user journey like in this app?</h3>
        <p>
            The user will immediately see a list of posts made about local
            events happening or general discussion, with a preview of the post
            content. When a user clicks to view a post, they will see the full
            content, as well as the comments section, where they can also add a
            comment. On the main page, the user can also create a post, with the
            title, the text, and a couple colour options (title/post info and
            outer border). However, the user will generally have a better
            experience if they log in with a username, which gives them the
            ability to edit/delete the post and have their posts/comments linked
            to their username. They will be able to log in/log out anytime in
            the top menu bar on the website.
        </p>
        <h3>What is the key takeaway for any user?</h3>
        <p>
            The key takeaway is that this web app is a simple way to find out
            about local events happening near you, with the digital convenience
            and without some big remote server running it.
